# Downloading normalDB_agilent_v7_hg19.rds

Due to the size of normalDB_agilent_v7_hg19.rds is 106.MB, exceeding maximum size of github. I put this file into my dkfz nextcloud directory here
[normalDB_agilent_v7_hg19.rds](https://hub.dkfz.de/s/zDiapYoAnPDAdjr)
Save this in into this directory (exon_sequencing/PureCN/selected_PoN/) then it can be used for PureCN copy-number calling workflow.
